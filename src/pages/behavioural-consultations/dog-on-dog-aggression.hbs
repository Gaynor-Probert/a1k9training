Dog on Dog Aggression
=====================

Dogs that are aggressive to other dogs, are very difficult to take for a walk and keep under control. This behaviour left unattended will become worse over time. The sooner you seek help from a professional behaviourist, the better your chances of rehabilitating your dog.
