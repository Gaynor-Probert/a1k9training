<p><strong>The most critical time in your dog's life is right now!</strong></p>

<p>Puppyhood is the time when your influence and what you do with your pup will have an everlasting effect.</p>

<p>The help and guidance you receive from Gaynor Probert at A1K9 Behaviour and Training Academy, can make a profound
  difference on the success of your relationship with your dog.</p>

<h3>Responsible dog ownership</h3>

<p>As your pup develops over the coming months, Gaynor will teach you the most important aspects of your dog's
  education and how to develop him to be the well behaved and balanced pet you have always wanted.</p>

<p>These classes are the starting point for all puppies under the age of 5 months.</p>
<p>You do not have to book into this half hour class. Once your puppy has had both its vaccinations you can come and
  join the fun. Puppies get the opportunity to meet and play with other pups off lead in our fenced fields under the
  watchful eye of Gaynor and her assistants, who with their specialist knowledge of dog body language will prevent any
  over exuberance.</p>

<p>We also have a large purpose built dog training barn so that we can go indoors when the weather is inclement. It is
  filled with sand for a soft landing when playing, ensuring that your puppy's socialisation and education continues
  no matter what the weather.</p>

<p>Puppies grow and mature much faster than humans, therefore the earlier you get your pup accepting and happy around
  dogs and people they don't know, the happier they will be in the both the company of people and other dogs that they
  meet.</p>

<p>Clicker training is one of the methods that Gaynor uses at A1K9 Behaviour and Training Academy, to condition your
  puppy ready to go on into the Bronze dog obedience course.</p>

<p>Teaching your dog to sit, to lie down and to return to you when called, is the beginning of you dogs training,
  achieved easily in fun environment with a clicker.</p>

  Over a period of weeks Gaynor will help and advise you with different aspects
  of responsible dog ownership:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    How to teach your puppy to inhibit the force of his play bites is the most
    important priority, for your puppy to develop a soft mouth and preventing
    what can be potentially serious problems in the future.
  </li>
  <li>
    Getting your dog acclimatized to walking on a lead in a controlled manner,
    to make walking with your dog a joy.
  </li>
  <li>
    How to handle and examine your young puppy is easy and essential; your
    groomer and veterinarian will be very grateful.
  </li>
  <li>Teach your puppy how to enjoy giving up valued items when requested.</li>
  <li>
    We establish the correct manner for your puppy to greet people, as early as
    possible.

  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>Only you can condition your puppy</strong> to living in your home and
  to accept and fit in to your lifestyle; but, having the help and guidance of
  Gaynor Probert at A1K9 Behaviour and Training Academy can have a profound
  effect that will enrich your relationship with your dog for many years to
