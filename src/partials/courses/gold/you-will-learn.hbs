  <h3>You Will Learn</h3>

  <h4>Off lead heel work.</h4>
  <p>In this course Gaynor teaches you how to incentivise your dog to stay at your side when you are walking the dog off
    lead.</p>

  <h4>Three minute stay.</h4>
  <p>We continue to practise your dog staying in the same position, aiming now for a three minute stay with people
    walking around to create a distraction.</p>

  <h4>Recall with distraction.</h4>
  <p>We improve the recall by calling your dog back to you when there are lots of distractions, such as other dogs
    running around and people walking about.</p>

  <h4>Left finish.</h4>
  <p>When the dog returns back you and into the present position, Gaynor will then show you how to get the dog to come
    around you and back into the heel position.This is called the left finish.</p>

  <h4>Recall back to heel.</h4>
  <p>Gaynor will also show you how to recall your dog back to the heelwork position when you are on the move.</p>

  <h4>Stand</h4>
  <p>It is in this class she teaches you how to get your dog to do a new position and that is the stand. Once your dog
    knows this we practise sit, down, and stand. Then we teach you the running down.</p>

  <h4>Find the toy.</h4>
  <p>To keep your dog interested and motivated she adds a new exercise. Teaching you how to get your dog to find his toy
    when it is amongst others.</p>
  <p>It is a proven fact that your dog's sense of smell when detecting sweat is a million times better than ours, your
    dog will welcome the opportunity to show off his superior sense of smell.</p>
